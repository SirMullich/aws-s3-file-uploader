This is a story of boy meets girl.

5
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,740
The boy, Tom Hansen
of Margate, New Jersey,

6
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:19,660
grew up believing that
he'd never truly be happy...

7
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,860
until the day he met "the one."

8
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:27,180
This belief stemmed from early exposure
to sad British pop music...

9
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,660
and a total misreading
of the movie The Graduate.

Since the disintegration
of her parents 'marriage'

14

she'd only loved two things.

The first was her long dark hair.

16
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:49,832
The second was how easily
she could cut it off...

and feel nothing.

Well, you don't believe that, do you?

It's love.
It's not Santa Claus.

Well, what does
that word even mean?

364
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,757
I've been in relationships,
and I don't think I've ever seen it.

365

in divorce these days.

There's no such thing as love.
It's a fantasy.

That's L.A.'s first skyscraper.

[Narrator] For Tom Hansen, this was the
night where everything changed.

663
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:44,220
That wall Summer
so often hid behind-

664
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:47,915
the wall of distance,
of space, of casual-

665
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:52,158
that wall was slowly coming down.

666
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,940
For here was Tom, in her world,

667
00:38:56,040 --> 00:39:00,460
a place few had been invited
to see with their own eyes.

668
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,780
And here was Summer,
wanting him there.

669
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:05,620

[Summer] You know, I dream
sometimes about flying.

00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:35,300
It starts out like I'm running
really, really fast.

I'm, like, superhuman.

682
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:40,700
And the terrain starts to get
really rocky and steep.

683
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:44,580
And then I'm running so fast that my feet
aren't even touching the ground.

684
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:49,310
And I'm floating,
and it's like this amazing, amazing realness.

I'm free. I'm safe.

686
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:56,060
Then I realize,

687
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,799
I'm completely alone.

688
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:04,220
And then I wake up.

[Narrator]
As he listened, Tom began to realize...

690
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:09,836
that these weren't stories
routinely told.

691

These were stories one had to earn.

He wondered if anyone else
had made it this far.

00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:23,820
which is why the next six words
changed everything.

1108
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:28,540
I guess I just got lucky.

1109
01:06:28,640 --> 01:06:30,980
Um, we met in elementary school.

1110
01:06:31,080 --> 01:06:34,020
In seventh grade
we had the same class schedule,

1111
01:06:34,120 --> 01:06:36,220
and, uh,

1112
01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:39,660
we just clicked, you know?

1113
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:41,340
Love?

1114
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:43,140
Shit, I don't know.

1115
01:06:43,240 --> 01:06:46,660
As long as she's cute
and she's willing, right?

1116
01:06:46,760 --> 01:06:50,260
I'm flexible on the cute, so-

1117
01:06:50,360 --> 01:06:52,940
Twenty-one years.

1118
01:06:53,040 --> 01:06:56,140
She's the light that guides me home.

1119
01:06:56,240 --> 01:06:59,300
Yes, that is from one of our cards.

1120
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:01,380
No. Someone else wrote it.

1121
01:07:01,480 --> 01:07:03,780
Doesn't make it less true.

1122
01:07:03,880 --> 01:07:06,500
I think technically
the "girl of my dreams"...

1123
01:07:06,600 --> 01:07:11,300
would probably have, like,
a really bodacious rack, you know.

1124
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:13,820
Maybe different hair.

1125
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:16,340
Probably- You know, she'd probably be
a little more into sports.

1126
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:19,780
But, um, truthfully,

1127
01:07:19,880 --> 01:07:23,660
Robyn's- Robyn's better
than the girl of my dreams.

1128
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:26,115
She's real.

Tom walked to her apartment,

1132
01:07:49,480 --> 01:07:52,340
intoxicated by
the promise of the evening.

1133
01:07:52,440 --> 01:07:55,140
# It's all right It's all right #
He believed that this time...

1134
01:07:55,240 --> 01:07:58,060
his expectations
would align with reality.

1135

# Hey, open wide

1137
01:08:11,240 --> 01:08:13,629
- Hi.
- Hey.

1138
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:18,620
# Hey, open wide, here comes original sin #
You look nice.

1139
01:08:18,720 --> 01:08:20,392
[Chuckles]
Yeah. Thanks.

1140
01:08:20,520 --> 01:08:22,180
- I like your tie. Wow!
- Hi.

1141
01:08:22,280 --> 01:08:23,872
- How you doing?
- Good. How are you?

1142
01:08:24,040 --> 01:08:26,220
Good.
# It's all right It's all right #

01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:39,348

That's so nice.

# No one's got it all #
Thank you.

1148
01:08:44,760 --> 01:08:45,658
You shouldn't have.

1149
01:08:45,758 --> 01:08:47,354
That's so nice. It's the-

1150
01:08:47,480 --> 01:08:49,357
- Thank you so much.
- No problem.

1151
01:08:49,480 --> 01:08:51,460
- I'm excited to read it.
- Yeah.

1152
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:53,500
Come on.

1153
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:55,660
# And we're going to these meetings #

1154
01:08:55,760 --> 01:08:59,700
- So, Tom, what is it that you do?
- Uh, I write greeting cards.

1155
01:08:59,800 --> 01:09:02,500
Tom could be a really great architect
if he wanted to be.

1156
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:04,740
[Woman]
That's unusual.

1157
01:09:04,840 --> 01:09:06,910
I mean, what made you go
from one to the other?

1158
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:09,220
I guess I just figured,

1159
01:09:09,320 --> 01:09:11,980
why make something disposable,
like a building,

1160
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:15,980
when you can make something
that lasts forever, like a greeting card?

- I'm great.
- What happened to you?

- Not this.
- Okay. Well, come on. Let's go.

- Where are we going?
- It's Thursday!

but, um, this is total shit.

1225
01:13:03,400 --> 01:13:05,580
- Tom!
- "Go for it" and "You can do it"?

1226
01:13:05,680 --> 01:13:07,780
That's not inspirational.
That's suicidal.

1227

If Pickles goes for it right there,
that's a dead cat.

1228
01:13:10,920 --> 01:13:13,900
These are lies. We're liars.

1229
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,340
Think about it.
Why do people buy these things?

1230
01:13:16,440 --> 01:13:18,740
It's not 'cause they want
to say how they feel.

1231
01:13:18,840 --> 01:13:22,799
People buy cards 'cause they can't say
how they feel, or they're afraid to.

01:13:22,920 --> 01:13:25,300
We provide the service
that lets them off the hook.

I say, to hell with it!
Let's level with America.

1235
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:31,600
At least let them speak
for themselves! Right?

1236
01:13:31,720 --> 01:13:34,900
I mean, look! What- what is this?
What does it say?

1237
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:36,900
"Congratulations on your new baby."
Right?

1238
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,180
How 'bout,
"Congratulations on your new baby.

1239
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:41,119
Guess that's it for hanging out.
Nice knowing you."

01:13:42,640 --> 01:13:45,195
How 'bout this one, with all
the pretty hearts on the front?

1242
01:13:45,295 --> 01:13:46,580
I know where this is going. Yep!

1243
01:13:46,680 --> 01:13:50,260
"Happy Valentine's Day,
sweetheart. I love you."

1244
01:13:50,360 --> 01:13:53,820
That sweet? Ain't love grand?

1245
01:13:53,920 --> 01:13:56,100
This is exactly
what I'm talking about.

1246
01:13:56,200 --> 01:13:58,260
What does that even mean, "love"?

1247
01:13:58,360 --> 01:14:01,140
Do you know? Do you? Anybody?

1248
01:14:01,240 --> 01:14:02,620
Tom.

1249
01:14:02,720 --> 01:14:05,712
If somebody gave me this card,
Mr. Vance, I would eat it.

1250
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:11,940
It's- It's these cards
and the movies, and the pop songs-

1251
01:14:12,040 --> 01:14:14,620
They're to blame for all the lies...

1252
01:14:14,720 --> 01:14:18,060
and the heartache, everything.

1253
01:14:18,160 --> 01:14:20,913
And we're responsible.
I'm responsible.

1254
01:14:23,800 --> 01:14:26,780
I think we do a bad thing here.

1255
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:30,420
People should be able to say
how they feel, how they really feel,

1256
01:14:30,520 --> 01:14:34,620
not, you know, some words that

01:28:42,240 --> 01:28:45,140
Yes. That's, like,
my favorite spot in the city.

1415
01:28:45,240 --> 01:28:47,196
Yeah. Okay. Except for
the parking lots, but-

1416
01:28:47,320 --> 01:28:49,197
- Yeah. I-I agree.
- Yeah, yeah.

1417
01:28:49,320 --> 01:28:51,311
- I think I've seen you there.
- Really?

1418
01:28:51,440 --> 01:28:54,273
- Yeah.
- I haven't seen you.

1419
01:28:56,040 --> 01:28:58,660
You must not have been looking.

1420
01:28:58,760 --> 01:29:00,740
[Narrator]
If Tom had learned anything,

1421
01:29:00,840 --> 01:29:03,860
it was that you can't ascribe
great cosmic significance...

1422
01:29:03,960 --> 01:29:06,076
to a simple earthly event.

1423
01:29:07,760 --> 01:29:11,700
Coincidence.
That's all anything ever is.

1424
01:29:11,800 --> 01:29:13,780
Nothing more than coincidence.

1425
01:29:13,880 --> 01:29:16,220
- [Man] Tom Hansen.
- Yeah.

1426
01:29:16,320 --> 01:29:18,311
- Come on back.
- Thank you.

1427
01:29:19,600 --> 01:29:23,580
Tom had finally learned
there are no miracles.

1428
01:29:23,680 --> 01:29:26,180
There's no such thing as fate.

1429
01:29:26,280 --> 01:29:28,700
Nothing is meant to be.

1430
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:32,340
He knew. He was sure of it now.

1431
01:29:32,440 --> 01:29:35,100
- Tom was-
- Sorry. Um-

1432
01:29:35,200 --> 01:29:37,395
I just left, uh-
Can I- one second.

1433
01:29:37,520 --> 01:29:40,220
[Narrator]
He was pretty sure.

1434
01:29:40,320 --> 01:29:43,420
- Hey.
- You again.

1435
01:29:43,520 --> 01:29:45,820
Yeah. I, uh, was just wondering...

1436
01:29:45,920 --> 01:29:49,196
if maybe after this, if, um, you-

1437
01:29:51,080 --> 01:29:53,700
you want to get some coffee
or something.

1438
01:29:53,800 --> 01:29:55,780
Oh, I'm sorry.

1439
01:29:55,880 --> 01:29:59,940
I'm sort of supposed to
meet someone after this.

1440
01:30:00,040 --> 01:30:01,996
Okay.

1441
01:30:09,320 --> 01:30:11,197
Sure.

1442
01:30:11,320 --> 01:30:13,900
- What's that?
- [Laughs] Why not?

1443
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:17,231
Okay. Well, then I'll just, uh-
I'll wait for you-

1444
01:30:17,360 --> 01:30:19,540
We- We'll figure it out.
We'll figure it out.

1445
01:30:19,640 --> 01:30:23,838
- My name's Tom.
- Nice to meet you. I'm Autumn.

1446
01:30:39,520 --> 01:30:43,140
[Man] # She's got you high
and you don't even know yet #

1447

1451
01:31:01,480 --> 01:31:04,900
# It's the search for the time
before it leaves without you #

1452
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:08,740
# Have you lost your mind
